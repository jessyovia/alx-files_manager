This repository contains the project "Files Manager," developed as part of the back-end trimester curriculum. The project is designed to build a simple, yet fully functional platform that allows users to authenticate, upload, manage, and view files. Key features include:

User Authentication: Secure user authentication via token-based methods.
File Management: List, upload, view, and modify permissions of files.
Image Processing: Automatic generation of thumbnails for image files.
Background Processing: Integration with Redis and Kue for efficient background task management.
Data Storage: Utilization of MongoDB for permanent data storage and Redis for temporary data storage.
Tech Stack:

Backend: NodeJS, ExpressJS
Database: MongoDB, Redis
Testing: Mocha
Other: Babel, ESLint, Nodemon, Kue
The project is a comprehensive exercise in building and integrating various backend components, reflecting real-world applications. Although similar services exist, this project is a learning exercise aimed at developing a full-fledged backend product.
